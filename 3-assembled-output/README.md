# Assembled output for Lander on the Acorn Archimedes

This folder contains the output binaries from the build process for Lander on the Acorn Archimedes.

It also contains [compile.txt](compile.txt) and [compile-RunImage.txt](compile-RunImage.txt), which contain the output from the assembly process for the main game and !RunImage file respectively. This is very useful when debugging the build process.
