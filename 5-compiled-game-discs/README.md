# Compiled game discs for Lander on the Acorn Archimedes

This folder contains the final disc files for Lander on the Acorn Archimedes, as produced by the build process. There is one folder for each supported variant, plus a folder for zips of each variant. These files can be loaded into an emulator like Arculator, or into a real Archimedes using a device like a Gotek.

It also contains LanderSrc,fff, which is a BBC BASIC-compatible file that will build Lander on an Archimedes.
